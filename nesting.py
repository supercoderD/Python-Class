#Write a program to check whether the student can take an exam or not. Students will be allowed only in two conditions: If they have a medical cause (‘Y’ for yes and ‘N’ for no). If yes, then they will be allowed. If No, then check attendance If attendance is above 75, then allowed; otherwise, not allowed.
medicalcause=input("Do you have a medical cause: ")
attendence=int(input("What is your attendance?"))
if medicalcause=="yes" or medicalcause=="y":
    print("Allowed")
else:
    
    if attendence>75:
        print("You are allowed into the test")
    else:
        print("You are not allowed in the test.")
